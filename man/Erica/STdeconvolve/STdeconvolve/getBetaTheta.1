.SH NAME
getBetaTheta \- get deconvolve result matrix
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fIgetBetaTheta(\fBLDA\fR as <generic> LdaGibbsSampler, 
\fBcorpus\fR as <generic> STCorpus, 
\fBtop_genes\fR as integer = 25);\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
get deconvolve result matrix
 
 Pull out cell-type proportions across pixels (theta) and
 cell-type gene probabilities (beta) matrices from fitted 
 LDA models from fitLDA
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
\fBLDA\fB \fR\- 
 an LDA model from `topicmodels`. From list of models returned by
 fitLDA
. 
.PP
.PP
\fBcorpus\fB \fR\- 
 If corpus is NULL, then it will use the original corpus that
 the model was fitted to. Otherwise, compute deconvolved topics from this
 new corpus. Needs to be pixels x genes and nonnegative integer counts. 
 Each row needs at least 1 nonzero entry (default: NULL)
. 
.PP
.PP
\fBtop_genes\fB \fR\- -. 
.PP
.SH VALUE
.PP
A Deconvolve object that contains

 + beta: cell-type (rows) by gene (columns) distribution matrix.
   Each row is a probability distribution of a cell-type expressing 
   each gene in the corpus.
 + theta: pixel (rows) by cell-types (columns) distribution matrix.
   Each row is the cell-type composition for a given pixel.
